        <p>The Akan are a meta-ethnicity living in the southern regions of present-day Ghana, formerly known as the Gold Coast. Akans who migrated from Ghana also make up a plurality of the ethnic population in the Ivory Coast. The Akan language (also known as Twi/Fante) is a group of dialects within the Central Tano branch of the Potou–Tano subfamily of the Niger–Congo family. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.</p>
        <p>There is an Akan maxim ne din ne ne honam sε (his/her name befits his/her body). </p>
        <p>The Akans call it kradin (lit.) ‘souls name’ and they believe that this is a name that a person’s soul offers him/her. </p>
        <p>Ghana‘s first president, Kwame Nkrumah, was born on a Saturday</p>
        <p>the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Atta Annan, was so named for being born on a Friday.</p>
